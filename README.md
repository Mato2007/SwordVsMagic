## About The Project

**SwordVsMagic** is a game that was built at Summer Camp for Computer Science (Poletni tabor računalništva 2021). Me and my "collaborator" named Dorian, had a lot of fun during the making of this project.  
I / ([@Mato2007](https://github.com/Mato2007)) wrote the code and Dorian took care of the pictures.
